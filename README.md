# InstagramAutomation
A small project to automate Instagram actions using Python and SELENIUM IDE.

This project will allow to implement the "Quote of the Day". That is, daily in the column "description" is changed by a random quote from the list of quotes.

In the future, it is planned to expand the functionality by adding the autolike function to all new posts.

For the program to work, the folder must also contain the current version of the chromedriver.exe file (it must match the current version of the Chrome browser), since the parser works on SELENIUM.

You can download from the link https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Good luck
